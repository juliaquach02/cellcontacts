# cellcontacts

This R package was written to process the data acquired from live cell imaging of T cells and tumor cells. It requires the prior analysis of live cell imaging films with a cell tracking tool, e.g., [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) or [Imaris](https://imaris.oxinst.com/products/imaris-for-tracking), and it offers a range of functions to compute cell-cell distances, cell-cell contacts and characteristics of the cell-cell contacts. Moreover, it allows to connect the results to immunological staining results.
