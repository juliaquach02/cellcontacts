# __About__

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This R package was written to process the data acquired from live cell imaging of T cells and tumor cells. It requires the prior analysis of the live cell imaging films with a cell tracking tool, e.g., [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) or [Imaris](https://imaris.oxinst.com/products/imaris-for-tracking), and it offers a range of functions to compute cell-cell distances, cell-cell contacts and characteristics of the cell-cell contacts. Moreover, it allows to connect the results to immunological staining results.

## __Goal of the project__

The goal of this R package is to enable the quantitative analysis of T cell-tumor cell interaction in live cell imaging films to deepen our understanding of the crucial factors for efficient T cell killing.
